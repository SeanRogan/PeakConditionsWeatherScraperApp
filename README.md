# PeakConditionsWeatherScraperApp

This project is aimed at creating a web service which will scrape weather data from www.Mountain-forcast.com and populate a database with the information. A RESTful API recieves Http requests which return info from the database. Register on the Website, choose your favorite mountains and hiking conditions and get updates in your email when a mountain is going to have a day with nice weather.
